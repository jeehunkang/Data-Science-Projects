#Group of my friends were very interested in finding out what salaries people would usually earn depending on their colleges and degrees. 
#Therefore, we had decided to use the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) to analyse the salaries by different colleges and degrees. 

#Regression tree for different major

tree.major=tree(Starting.Median.Salary~Undergraduate.Major,data=major)
summary(tree.major)
plot(tree.major)
text(tree.major,pretty=0)

tree.major=tree(Mid.Career.Median.Salary~Undergraduate.Major,data=major)
plot(tree.major)
text(tree.major,pretty=0)


#Regression tree for school type

contrasts(School.Type)
tree1 = tree(Starting.Median.Salary ~ School.Type , data = type)
summary(tree1)
plot(tree1)
text(tree1)

tree1 = tree(Mid.Career.Median.Salary ~ School.Type , data = type)
summary(tree1)
plot(tree1)
text(tree1)

#Regression tree for region
region=read.csv("region.csv")
attach(region)
names(region)
table(region$Starting.Median.Salary)
contrasts(Region)
tree2 = tree(Starting.Median.Salary ~ Region, data = region)
summary(tree2)
